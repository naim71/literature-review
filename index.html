        <td>One of the most quickly degradable veggies is onion. As a result, it's critical to keep an eye on the temperature and humidity levels while preserving onions. Onions are kept in controlled environment facilities to ensure a year-round supply. Even if no deterioration or damage is obvious, infected onions put the entire harvest in the storage facility at risk. The proposed technique will aid in the reduction of onion degradation caused by changes in temperature and humidity. If one of the onions in the onion storage begins to deteriorate, this mechanism will alert the farmer. This system allows for the monitoring of all desired parameters as well as the provision of maximal onion quality control. As a result, the quality of the preserved onion will not deteriorate, saving the farmers a significant financial loss.

Red onion plants grown in a hydroponic planting media are grown without the need of soil and rely solely on water, nutrients, and oxygen. The proposed system was designed to track the temperature of the water, nutrition, ambient temperature, and light intensity. The average value of water temperature, nutrition, air temperature, and light intensity, as well as the number of plant leaves and their height, were measured during the system performance test. The water temperature sensor, air temperature sensor, light sensor, GSM SIM800L, LM2596 Relay module, and Arduino Uno as a microprocessor are all used in this monitoring system. This test was carried out on shallot crops for eight weeks, and the results represent the average value of weekly counted data. Since the plant was in the form of seeds, this test was carried out.

In this journal they devised and developed an electronic circuitry based on the needs of the user that can provide early warning and give signals to the owner . This technology operates on the idea of monitoring and processing onions' released gases to produce the desired output. Emitted gases are detected by sensors, which immediately send signals to a microcontroller, which reads and processes them. The owner will be notified through audio-visual alarm and text message. They utilized a green-coloured net and fan to control other variables such as temperature and humidity. Sensors, a microcontroller, and actuators form the basis of this system. Onions release gases that can be detected with a variety of gas sensors. These sensors detect gases, which are then supplied to a microprocessor for further processing. A LCD display, an alarming device , and a wireless data transfer device make up the system. Here, cooling agents such as a fan and a shed-net are utilized. The automation of the cooling agent device, namely the fan , is controlled at various temperature levels set in the program. Onions can be kept for 8 to 10 months with the help of this technique.

Desiccation, rotting, and sprouting in storage result in the loss of a considerable number of onions. As a result, their price rises four to five times. They came up with a way to keep onions fresh. Temperature and humidity have been monitored in this system using temperature and humidity sensors. They've developed an onion harvesting detection system that uses Arduino, an LM35 temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a gas sensor, and a GSM module. The LM35 temperature sensor, gas sensor MQ 137, and sending SMS warnings to mobile phones saved inside the Arduino program are used to sense ammonia gas, temperature, and humidity. In this study, a thermoelectric cooling system is used to maintain the quality and quantity of onions, which is then monitored using IoT. Using Peltier tiles technology can control the temperature inside the cell for onion preservation. With Google's help, this approach may be easily adjusted and applied based on the quantity of onion.

        <td>POST HARVEST MANAGEMENT OF FUNGAL DISEASES IN ONION</td>
        <td>Onion post-harvest losses are influenced by a number of factors. Physiological activity (Transpiration, Respiration, Senescence, Sprouting), biochemical activity (Enzymatic, Tissue softening), and microbial invasion (Fungi, Bacteria) are examples of these. They worked on fungal infections in onions in this article. In particular, fungal diseases and the losses caused by them in onion throughout the post-harvest phase. Due to storage disease damage, around 35-40% of onions are lost. During the storage of different kinds, fungal bulb rot causes roughly 15-30% losses. Various fungal pathogen species attack onion bulbs during the post-harvest storage phase, including Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., Alternaria spp., Fusarium spp., Rhizopus spp., Colletotrichum spp., Pseudomonas spp., Lactobacillus spp., Erwinia spp., Botrytis spp. In the field and during post-harvest storage. Aspergillus spp. (especially A.niger) is the most virulent fungal pathogen. The fungus that causes black mold is a member of the Aspergillus genus and it is primarily a plant disease that causes post-harvest degradation of stored food products. In light of these concerns, some fungal disease prevention strategies for storage were discussed. Synthetic fungicides, novel preventive measures, nanoparticles, copper nanoparticles, sulphur and zinc oxide nanoparticles are some of the options. For decreasing storage losses in onions, more than 50 synthetic fungicides are indicated. The use of several synthetic fungicides to treat onion post-harvest diseases is common practice, but their toxicity and the rise of pathogen resistance requires the development of fungicidal formulations derived from plants to control fungal pathogens. Trichoderma spp. has been reported to have the most impact on pathogens among the various fungus. Various strategies for identifying fungal pathogens must be developed in order to target the pathogen that is afflicting Onion bulbs during the post-harvest period. To avoid any type of health threat to customers, various fungicidal formulations, particularly bio-fungicidal formulations, should be employed.</td>

        <td>Agriculture is the primary source of income for many people in many parts of the world. Unfortunately, farmers are still dependant on hundreds of years-old techniques. Due to the different limits in agriculture, there is an urgent need to improve and financially feasible crop-growing systems. In agriculture farming, wireless technologies and automation are required. Many wireless technologies, such as remote sensing, global positioning systems, and geographic information systems, were applied in agriculture. In the development of numerous crops, the necessity for intelligent farming has developed to a greater extent. The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently changed all of the world's major economic sectors and industries. The status and functional condition of equipment (closed / open, on /off, full /empty) can be determined remotely using the Internet of Things. A unique wireless mobile robot based on the Internet of Things (IoT) is conceived and implemented in this study for conducting various activities in the field. This suggested wireless robot is outfitted with a variety of sensors that can measure a variety of environmental conditions. It also comes with Raspberry Pi 2 model B hardware for running the whole thing. The key features of this unique intelligent wireless robot include moisture detecting, scaring birds and animals, spraying pesticides, moving forward or backward, and turning on/off electric motors. In the robot, there is a wireless camera. Thermo Hygro Sensor, pH Sensor, UV Sensor, Humidity Sensor, PIR Sensor, CO2 Sensor, and more sensors are included. Wireless crop monitoring reduces labor costs while also allowing for accurate tracking of changes that occur in real time at the field. The proposed system has the ability to control the critical factors for plant growth.</td>

        <td>To reduce crop waste, an initiative is attempting to convert traditional onion warehouses into smart warehouses. Monitoring technology that sends real-time updates on the health of onion stock. The project focuses on optimizing onion storage with minimal loss, from design and structure to storage protocols, microclimatic conditions, and material. This onion warehouse monitoring system is a cost-effective way to keep onions from spoiling. Sensors in these systems, such as the DHT22 and MQ 2, record a variety of parameters that are utilized to detect spoilage. The data is displayed on a dashboard in a variety of graphical representations and can be viewed in real time. There is live monitoring dashboard can be accessed from the Ada website by anyone with login details. All graphs are updated in real time and respective data logs are displayed. Clients can perceive sensor data from their devices from any location. Furthermore, Clients will get alerts via email at a regular interval of every 25 minutes and whenever abnormalities are spotted. This idea is tremendous for onion farming and also it is profitable for a farmer. Farmer will be able to pass a great loss.

        <td>Monitoring Onion Crop “Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria IGP” Growth and Yield Response to Varying Nitrogen Fertilizer Application Rates Using UAV Imagery
        </td>
        <td>The goal of this study is to determine the appropriate level of nitrogen-based fertilizers in an onion field for increased productivity. Multispectral (MS) UAV footage was used to track the crop cycle, resulting in vigor maps. Based on the production statistics, plot N180 had a greater onion yield. On this paper they focused about the optimal level of nitrogen-based nutrients for an improved productivity in an onion field. They monitored the entire crop cycle, producing vigor maps using MS UAV imagery. Evidence suggests that increasing the N dose up to 180 kg N ha−1 produces increasing benefits for plant metabolism and growth. The dose of N210 brought benefits in terms of growth but up to a certain point, beyond which no benefit is observed for the crop. Reductions in vegetation vigor in plots where the experiment included applying the highest dose are probably attributable to adverse effects caused by excess salinity. Precision agriculture (PA) is defined by the International Society of Precision Agriculture (ISPAG) as a management system that collects, processes, and analyzes temporal, spatial, and individual data. Aerial monitoring using remote sensing techniques offers a variety of data collection and map generating options. In PA applications, satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles are frequently used. Photosynthesis and various physiological and biochemical activities in plant metabolism rely heavily on nitrogen fertilizer. Onion quality and shelf life can be improved with proper N fertilizer management, which has a beneficial economic impact. Onion fertilization can be made more sustainable by selecting the right formulation, treatment timings, and doses for the crop.

System collects the field data in real time through deployed sensors and recommends usage with necessary precautions and decisions. The proposed design consists of various sensors that collect real-time data from environment and field. Smart fuzzy logic and blockchain technology is implemented for timely analysis and securing the network. Multiple users can monitor and interact with the system remotely by using the proposed intelligent agricultural system. The study aims to present an automatic intelligent agricultural system that is capable of monitoring climate and providing an efficient utilization of water resources. The adopted blockchain technology provides secure information access among connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed ICWAS monitors climate, light intensity, temperature, humidity, and water content in soil through deployed sensors. The sensed information is then transferred on the server through Wi-Fi for providing the customized guidance of watering and continuously monitoring the plant's health. An ICWAS provides a real-time monitoring of field from a distant place by simply accessing the smart devices across any part of the world. The design also provides the remote interaction with plants, thereby a farmer can adjust the watering amount as per the requirement of specific plant. In the proposed system, the blockchain module is designed using Java, and the blocks contents is defined as hash, which acts as a unique identifier. Each of the block is capable for computing block hash, and then secure hash algorithm hash is evaluated based on it. The blockchains are looped over to verify the validation of entire blockchain system.

        <td>Internet of Things-Based Smart Farming Monitoring System for Bolting Reduction in Onion Farms
        </td>
        <td>Bolting is a sneaky phenomenon that affects onion plants as a result of changes in environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and light intensity. Bolting occurs when an onion plant produces its flowering stem before the crop is picked, resulting in a low-quality harvest and yield. As a result, it is critical for farmers to keep an eye on and control environmental parameters in order to avoid bolting. They proposed and designed a new prototype for bolting reduction in this study, namely a smart farming monitoring system (SFMS), which is built on a generic three-layered IoT architecture. A more favorable environment can be supplied to prevent and eliminate onion bolting by utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) technologies and attentive remote monitoring. A genuine test-bed implementation was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and performance of the proposed SFMS. To monitor onion crops, the SFMS prototype was put both in the open and in a greenhouse environment. The percentage of onion bolting was 16.7% in the open environment and 3% in the closed environment, according to sensor data. The SFMS was used to give appropriate temperature, humidity, and light intensity to the onion crops in a contained environment. As a result, the percentage of onions that bolted was reduced from 16.7% to 3%, resulting in increased onion production.

The system will send an SMS to the Farmer if the reservoir's water level drops below a specified level. The farmer can use a mobile application to manage the water line and fill the reservoir. The farm's light and temperature are controlled by an LDR and DHT11 humidity sensor. We also used a pH sensor in the system, which is a scientific equipment that monitors hydrogen-ion activity in water-based solutions and indicates its acidity or alkalinity as pH.

        <td>The current study used morpho-physiological and molecular markers to estimate the genetic variability and variety of 20 onion genotypes. To examine the effects on yield-attributing and bulb-quality attributes, the genotypes were tested for two years in a row. With 31 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, molecular diversity was found. There was sufficient genetic heterogeneity among the genotypes, with additive gene action predominating in the inheritance of most of the features. Seven principal components (PCs) were discovered to account for more than 87 percent of the genetic variability in the genotypes, according to PC analyses. The first two PCs were shown to be positively linked with total yield (kg/plot), Grade 'C' bulb (equatorial diameter of the bulb between 3.5 and 4.5 cm), individual bulb weight (g), and phenol content. A total of 16 primers were amplified, and they produced 32 alleles in the genotypes. Genetic diversity at the morphological and molecular levels indicated moderate diversity among the tested genotypes, with the dissolution of the genotypes into six and three clusters, respectively. The present study on onion facilitates the selection of diverse parents that can generate desirable segregants in future breeding programs.

This paper describes a wireless sensor network hydroponic system that employs the most cutting-edge IoT-based technology. This device can monitor and analyze hydroponic plant parameters in real time using a computer or a smartphone. A modest network of hydroponic systems with numerous sensor nodes will be created as a prototype. pH, light intensity, water level temperature, and humidity sensors are among the sensors employed. To monitor the hydroponic plants in advance, an investigation of the changes in gathering data from sensors will be carried out. As a result, this initiative can replace the manual monitoring system and assist farmers in monitoring important environmental elements ahead of time, even while they are outstation.

This technology can be used to generate organic food to meet the world's ever-increasing demand for food. Because the system recycles the water it uses, the quality of the water must be checked at regular intervals. Manually completing this task might be quite exhausting. As a result, the Internet of Things (IoT) can be a useful tool for this goal. This will significantly reduce human intervention in the system while simultaneously increasing its efficiency. The use of cutting-edge technology such as the Internet of Things can aid in the implementation of this system in urban locations such as smart cities, where traditional farming is not viable, and generate locally grown organic food. The technique proposed here involves employing various sensors to continuously check the water quality and the plant's surroundings. Using the Internet of Things, the data collected by the sensors may be accessed remotely.
